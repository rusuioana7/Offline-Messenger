# Offline-Messenger
Offline Messenger is a client/server application implemented in C using a TCP/IP protocol designed to facilitate message
exchange between connected users, including the ability to send messages to
offline users. This platform ensures that users receive messages when they reconnect to the server, letting them know through a notification. Additionally,
users have the capability to respond specifically to certain received messages and
the functionality to track conversation history for each individual user.
